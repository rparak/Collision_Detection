## Requirements

**Programming Language**

```bash
Python
```

**Import Libraries**
```bash
More information can be found in the individual scripts (.py).
```

**Supported on the following operating systems**
```bash
Windows, Linux, macOS
```

## Project Description
The library can be used within the Robot Operating System (ROS), Blender, PyBullet, Nvidia Isaac, or any program that allows Python as a programming language.

A detailed description of each algorithm can be found in the library.
## 3D Shape Intersections

A description of how to run a program to evaluate an algorithm to check whether two 3D primitives overlap (intersect) or not.
1. Open Overlap.blend from the Blender folder.
2. Copy and paste the script from the evaluation folder (../overlap_boxes.py).
3. Run it and evaluate the results.
   
```bash
$ /> cd Documents/GitHub/Collision_Detection/Blender/Collision_Detection
$ ../Collision_Detection/Blender> blender Overlap.blend
```

## 3D Point Tests

A description of how to run a program to evaluate an algorithm to determine if a given point is inside a geometric object.
1. Open Point_Inside.blend from the Blender folder.
2. Copy and paste the script from the evaluation folder (../point_inside_box.py).
3. Run it and evaluate the results.
   
```bash
$ /> cd Documents/GitHub/Collision_Detection/Blender/Collision_Detection
$ ../Collision_Detection/Blender> blender Point_Inside.blend
```

## 3D Line Intersections

A description of how to run a program to check if a line segment intersects with 3D primitive object.
1. Open Raycast.blend from the Blender folder.
2. Copy and paste the script from the evaluation folder (../raycast_box.py).
3. Run it and evaluate the results.
   
```bash
$ /> cd Documents/GitHub/Collision_Detection/Blender/Collision_Detection
$ ../Collision_Detection/Blender> blender Raycast.blend
```
